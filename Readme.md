# Scantina iOS Application

## Project is still in early development, use at own risk until completed.

## Description
* Barcode scanning application for iOS platforms



## Screen Shots


## Lessons Learned
* I found the native iOS barcode scanning speed lacking for certain types of barcodes.
This project uses the GoogleMLKit MLKitBarcodeScanning to process scans and is much faster.


### Frameworks
*UIKit
*AVKit
*AVFoundation
*Contacts
*QuartzCore
*MessageUI
*Firebase
*GoogleMLKit
